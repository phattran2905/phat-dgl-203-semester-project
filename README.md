## Description
This game explores the pokemon world, where players can nurture and compete with each other. Each player has a collection of pokemon, and they will need different items to nurture them. By exploring the pokemon world, the players can acquire many rewards such as experience points, boosting items, or new pokemon.

## Features
### Authentication
A player is considered a trainer in this game and will receive rewards whenever they level up. Therefore, the more levels, the more benefits they get.

### Pokemon
There are two types of Pokemon in this game: the wild ones and the ones you own. You can see what Pokemon you have owned and what wild Pokemon you found. You can boost their strength by leveling up or with items.

### Items
This game has three types of items: Pokeball, Mystic Items, and Consumable Items. Whenever you find a wild Pokemon, you need Pokeball to catch it. You can catch Pokemon at the first use, depending on the capture rate. Don't worry if you missed it. You can find and try to catch them again on the Pokemon page. Mystic Items increase the power of Pokemon, while Consumable Items increase their experience points. You can receive these items if you win the battle.

### Shop (*)
The shop will not be available now since I don't have time to work on it.

### Explore
You can find wild Pokemon here, and you can choose to catch them or get in a battle with them.

### Catch
The capture rate will be stacked so. Eventually, you can catch wild Pokemon as long as the rate turns 100.

### Battle
For the battle, you only win the Pokemon if you have the higher power score. You will receive additional experience points for both trainer and Pokemon. Moreover, three random items will hand to you after the fight.
