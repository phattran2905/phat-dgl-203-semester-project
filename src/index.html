            <p class="guide__description">They are the main objects in this game and play an important role in the trainer's exploration. Each
              pokemon has many traits, such as strength, agility, magic, and defense. Every time they level up, these
              traits increase and can be boosted by items. Besides the traits above, pokemon also have skills and earn
              a new skill if they reach a specific level or evolve.</p>

              Pokeball is used to catch wild pokemon, and if it succeeds, the pokemon will belong to the thrower.
              Otherwise, it will be gone, and the trainer will have to use another one. Mystic items boost pokemon's
              traits in a certain amount of time. However, some rare items affect permanently. Consumable items
              recharge the trainer and pokemon's stamina and have limited usage.

              A trainer might find nearby wild pokemon while using this feature. Whenever a trainer finds a wild
              pokemon, they can either beat them for rewards or choose to use Pokeball to catch them. If they lose,
              they will not lose anything, including game resources such as health and mana points.

            <p class="guide__description">
              In a battle, pokemon take turns to cast their skills. The one who has a lower level will become the
              first one to case their skills; however, it will cost mana points. In addition, the health bar will
              decrease after the pokemon is hit. Whoever runs out of the health bar will lose the battle.
              When the trainer beats a wild pokemon, they will gain experience points for the pokemon and themselves.
              In addition, they also receive gold and a random item.
