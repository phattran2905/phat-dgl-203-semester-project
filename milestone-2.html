  <h1>Semester Project – Milestone 2</h1>
  <!-- Gameplay -->
  <section>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
      This game explores the pokemon world, where players can nurture and compete with each other. Each player has a
      collection of pokemon, and they will need different items to nurture them. By exploring the pokemon world, the
      players can acquire many rewards such as experience points, boosting items, or new pokemon.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Trainer</b>
        <p>
          A player is considered a trainer in this game and will receive rewards whenever they level up. Therefore, the
          more levels, the more benefits they get.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Pokemon</b>
        <p>
          They are the main objects in this game and play an important role in the trainer's exploration. Each pokemon
          has many traits, such as strength, agility, magic, and defense. Every time they level up, these traits
          increase and can be boosted by items.
          Besides the traits above, pokemon also have skills and earn a new skill if they reach a specific level or
          evolve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Items</b>
        <p>
          Pokeball is used to catch wild pokemon, and if it succeeds, the pokemon will belong to the thrower. Otherwise,
          it will be gone, and the trainer will have to use another one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mystic items boost pokemon's traits in a certain amount of time. However, some rare items affect permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consumable items recharge the trainer and pokemon's stamina and have limited usage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Shop</b>
        <p>
          This shop sells game items such as Pokeball, Mystic, and Consumable items. In particular, it costs the trainer
          gold to purchase those items. In addition, trainers can trade their items here and receive gold in return.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rewards</b>
        <p>
          When the trainer beats a wild pokemon, they will gain experience points for the pokemon and themself. In
          addition, they also receive gold and a random item.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Explore</b>
        <p>
          A trainer might find nearby wild pokemon while using this feature. Whenever a trainer finds a wild pokemon,
          they can either beat them for rewards or choose to use Pokeball to catch them. If they lose, they will not
          lose anything, including game resources such as health and mana points.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Battle</b>
        <p>
          In a battle, pokemon take turns to cast their skills. The one who has a lower level will become the first one
          to case their skills; however, it will cost mana points. In addition, the health bar will decrease after the
          pokemon is hit. Whoever runs out of the health bar will lose the battle.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Goals -->
  <section>
    <h2>Website Goals</h2>
    <p>
      I come up with this project to create a pokemon game where players can have a collection of different species of
      pokemon. Moreover, they can nurture and train them to become stronger in the game to evolve and proceed to their
      new transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the gameplay is designed to play with a low frequency. In other words, players spend only about
      1-2 hours on the game but continually each day. This strategy balances the valuation of pokemon collections
      between players. If they want to go faster than usual, they will need to pay more to buy items in the game.
    </p>

  <!-- Advantages -->
  <section>
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike other pokemon games, each trainer can only have one specific kind of pokemon. In other words, if they
      already own a Pikachu, they can not catch another one in this game. In addition, game activities cost stamina
      points, and they will be recharged after an amount of time. This strategy will limit the base time that a player
      will spend. They must pay for more advantages if they want to exceed the limit.
    </p>

  <!-- KPI -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>New users:</b> The number of new users simulates brand awareness in the market. If it increases, the
        marketing strategy works because more people know about this game.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Active users:</b> The active users indicate how well the game performs and the players' satisfaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sales:</b> Since the game activities cost resources and restrain the game resources, players need to pay to
        exceed the limited resources. This indicator is measured by players' money paid for diamonds.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Sitemap -->

    <h2>Sitemap</h2>

    <br>
    <p>
      In general, the site map contains most of the primary features. However, it lacks a trainer profile page and a
      page
      for the pokemon's evolvement.
    </p>

    <div>
      <b>Improvement</b>
      <p>
        Thanks to comments from other classmates, I need to make some adjustments to improve the project. In particular,
        I
        need to create a tutorial page that guides newcomers to play this game. In addition, I also need to add a menu
        to
        navigate between pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, I also came up with additional features that support the project to achieve the goals and the
        listed KPIs. In particular, I will add a shop to the game so players can exceed the limited resources and do
        more
        game activities. The shop sells two types of items: gold and diamond items. The player needs to purchase
        diamonds
        with their money. Meanwhile, the player can sell their items to the shop to earn gold.
      </p>

  <!-- SEO -->
  <section>
    <h2>SEO Keywords</h2>
    <p>
      Since this project narrowed down to a specific topic and is a game, I feel like "Pokemon" is the only keyword that
      can be used for SEO. On the other hand, if I name the game, it will start with the word "Pokemon" or include them
      in the name and use it as a keyword for SEO. However, as a game, most of the content will display graphics and
      content related to the gameplay. Therefore, this case is not suitable for putting keywords to satisfy SEO
      purposes.
